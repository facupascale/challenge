## Challenge

There a few custom scripts:

```bash
# using yarn
yarn ios:install
```

This script is going to install the PODS in IOS folder, the idea with this script is that everyone has the same pod version.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn all:dev
```

This script is for running in both OS (android, ios) and also stats the Metro Server.
